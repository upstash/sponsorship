# Upstash is Sponsoring Projects

Upstash is sponsoring open source projects to support the Redis and Kafka
ecosystem as well as to increase the user base of the Upstash. The projects
should be:

- Actively maintained.
- At least 100 stars.
- Have a similar user audience with Upstash Redis or Kafka.

We ask the sponsored project maintainers to put one of the below ads to their readme page.

If you think your project is a candidate, contact us at support@upstash.com.
